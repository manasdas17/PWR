  abstract = {This report investigates the suitability of a number of broadcast
	band transmitters of opportunity for a passive radar. Specifically,
	this reviews reviews the design of active radar waveforms, measures
	emissions for representative transmitters of opportunity, and assesses
	the suitability of these signals for various types of radar observation.
	This shows shows that it is indeed possible to construct the suggested
	passive radar, although performance is limited and depends largely
	on parameters, parameters, such as receiver bandwidth, antenna pattern
	and observation time.},
