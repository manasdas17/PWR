  title = {A GNU Radio Based Software-Defined Radar},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {GNU Radio is an open source software-defined radio project, and the
	Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) is hardware designed specifically
	for use with GNU Radio. Together, these two technologies have been
	used to implement very sophisticated, yet low cost, software-defined
	radios. Since software-defined radio and software-defined radar are
	really one in the same technologies, it stands to reason that GNU
	Radio and the USRP could be utilized to form a low cost radar sensor.
	In this thesis, we discuss the design of a prototype software-defined
	radar, built using the open source GNU Radio and open specification
	USRP projects. The prototype design is introduced, followed by the
	results of laboratory testing. A discussion on the expected operational
	performance of the prototype is then provided. The thesis concludes
	with the development and analysis of a waveform optimization algorithm
	that is capable of improving signal to interference plus noise ratio
	in the presence of a band-limited interferer. The low computational
	complexity of this algorithm make it amenable to software-defined
	radar.},

  title = {A Pulsed Doppler-Effect Radar Wind Profiler Transceiver Using GNU
	Radio and the Universal Software Radio},
  school = {ANU},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {Pulsed Doppler-effect radar wind profilers emit short pulses of electromagnetic
	radiation
	
	which are reflected back by atmospheric elements at a Doppler-shifted
	frequency and with
	
	a time delay proportional to the reflector?s distance. This shift
	and delay can be measured
	
	and thus atmospheric wind velocities determined.
	
	 Implementing a software-defined transceiver to emit these pulses
	and record returned
	
	signals using the low-cost, general availability Universal Software
	Radio Peripheral (USRP)
	
	hardware presents exciting opportunities for removing much complexity
	from the hard-
	
	ware domain, for future system expansion and for increasing Signal-to-Noise
	Ratio (SNR)
	
	through oversampling.
	
	 This Thesis presents such a design. Performance is shown to be limited
	by digital
	
	clock instability, which can be addressed through hardware modification
	of the USRP
	
	device. The lack of hardware multipliers on the USRP Field-Programmable
	Gate Array
	
	(FPGA) makes implementation of complex signal processing blocks such
	as filters chal-
	
	lenging.},
