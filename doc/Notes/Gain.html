<h1>DBSRX Daughter Board</h1>

<p>
A MGA82563 15dB to 20dB gain preamp - noise figure 2dB to 3dB.
</p>

<p>
A MAX2118 Direct Conversion Receiver. Dynamic range (AGC) of 60dB. Baseband gain of at least 19dB. It outputs 800mV p-p (283mV RMS) which is 2.04dBm across 50 Ohmns. The max gain input to the receiver to produce this output is typically -77dBm and max -72dBm. Therefore the typical maximum gain is 79dB.
</p>

<h1>USRP Board</h1>
<p>
The ADC requires 2V p-p (0.707V RMS) for full scale which is 10dBm across 50 Ohmns. The ADC has a 0 to 20dB gain amp in front.
</p>

<h1>Maximum Sensitivity</h1>

<p>
The maximum sensitivity is -79dB - 15dB + 5dB = -89dBm = 1.3 * 10^-12 Watts = 7.9 * 10^-6 V across 50 Ohmns (??).
